<div class="about">
	<h1>Tijana Jung: frontend web developer</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a computer science major at WGU from Columbus, OH.</p>
	<p>My passion is creating unique user experiences with svelte.js or react.js. I also like to experiment with different technologies (like svgs for this site)!
         
        </p>
    <p>I created this swamp-themed portfolio site because I'm a hobbist environmentalist, and the wetlands are my favorite biome. To me, they're not just essential, but beautiful too. </p>

    <p><b>Did you know</b> that wetlands are natural water filters? They can help prevent the formation of dead zones by absorbing agricultural waste!</p>
    <p>When I'm not spitting mad CSS, I like to paint. I'm not very good at it, but it's fun. </p>
