    <h2>Calculator</h2>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>This is a simple calculator app. 
        To be honest, I just made it for my portfolio. </p>
    <p>It was made in typescript, and uses a simple 
        functional programing paradigm. It does use the 
    very controversial JavaScript eval function, but because 
    the user can't type in any additional characters, and there's no
    user data collected, I thinkit's a negligable risk.</p>
